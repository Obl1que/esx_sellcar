# esx_sellcar

## Info

I would not reccomend changing the current location set in config.lua. If you do change it, you will have to spawn ped etc. in a different location, as I forgot about the multiple locations while coding this.

Anyone can change this script to their liking, but do **not** redistribute copies of this script without giving credit to the creator. Even if you are giving other people a changed copy, please still credit the owner.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository, and make sure the name is **"esx_sellcar"**
2. Change config.lua to your liking, instructions for each setting are in there.
3. Change your server.cfg to start esx_sellcar
4. Move the esx_sellcar folder to your server resources.
5. Restart your server (or start the resource)
6. Done!
